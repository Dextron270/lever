Good programming language website has to account for following:

1) What's the name?
2) what does it do in a sentence?
3) how do I get it
4) what do I do now?
5) where do I find more information
6) is it a clean layout/typography
7) good color scheme

   presentation + content + relevance


Step outside of the thing you made, and judge it as if you knew
nothing about it in particular, and not much about this kind of
software in general.

Don't assume anything. ELI5.

Exclude distractions away. You require no noise to get your point through.

infographic minus graphic -- show, don't tell.

DOWNLOAD --> think about where does this lead.
             should be clean, simple. No hassle.

It is possible that there needs to be more tutorials on the website, and a
documentation index.

Getting started -guide should likely be more articulated, it should be more
visible on the landing site as well.

Things the website should perhaps cover:

    It's graphics&media focused, desktop app focused, this is mostly
    social aspect but should reflect on libraries.

    in python, when you want to make a desktop app with interactive
    display, you got to download lots of stuff besides python at least you
    need glmatrix and opengl, and possibly a library to open the window

    OpenGL is included with graphic drivers, but you need tools to use it.

    Displaying information is huge thing in computing, even if people
    commonly see it as games and stuff.

If everything else fails, let's make hexagonal mines -game and a text editor,
then dump the screenshost to the front.
