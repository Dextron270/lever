I realise I've reached a point in Pyllisp where it presents worthwhile ideas, yet nobody gets to discover that because:

 * They do not have a reason to try it out.
 * They do not see a way to try out pyllisp, even if they owned a platform to try that out.
 * They don't know what are the coolest things to try out in pyllisp.


Fixing this problem will mean that an occassional visitor in the repository might gain some value from visiting it.

Fixing it also opens a way for people to contribute into the project, or start to apply it for something. I don't know if I want that yet because lot in the repository is explorative at the time of writing this. I'm changing out things and occassionally I change things out a lot.

To make it easier to try out pyllisp, especially in its current state, I made two specific scripts: `setup.py` and `run.py` to help out people.
