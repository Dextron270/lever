#module{doctools}
Describes how the documentation tools work in Lever. Not
complete or comprehensive description.

Lever's documentation tools supports an upwards workflow
where the documentation follows the source code. This helps
to ensure that the documentation is indeed accurate
documentation and not merely good wishes.

Comprehensive and good documentation is a very different thing
than the source code, therefore the source code and
documentation remain in different files. The documentation
is contained in the 'doc' -directory that is copied along
into the runtime distribution.

The documentation is accessible to runtime, although the
tools to retrieve and read documentation in REPL do not
currently exist.

Documentation is written in texopic -language. The language
is remotely similar with XML or HTML but has an exception
that it differentiates between vertical and horizontal
elements in the text. The details about the language will
appear in the texopic module docs.

A single documentation file functions as both a manual and a
reference. It is usable as both with searching, indexing and
filtering tools.

The appropriate reference cards are pointed out by groups
within the text. The cards contain lot of information that
is treated appropriately.

The description of all fields is not completed.

#begin{object}{macros}
#interface #ref{doc:/base}{dict}

#summary JSON-compatible structure that contains a listing
about all the Texopic segments and groups recognized by doctools.

#description Is not containing the recognized macros. This
is useful in combination with the texopic.read_file.

#status volatile
#end{object}

Since Lever is a very amenable language for change it is
important to communicate when things may change. Sometimes
it may even require that we know how and why things change.
For this reason we have a 'status/0' group separator that is
present in all reference card groups.

If the status field is missing, it means that the details of
the object described in the reference are highly stable. The
changes of such function are only allowed after a major
version change. Changes into such details may require a
transition time to be scheduled.

The documentation generator automatically adds #;status
volatile into every reference card. This means that the
author reserves the option to change the interface and that
only the exact version or even an exact git commit is
required for the program that uses this function.

Volatile status is meant for the situation where the status
of a specific interface is not determined. Another status,
internal, can be used to point out that the documented item
is an internal implementation detail not meant for external
use. Relying on such features require same measurements as
if the status was 'volatile'.
