    <p>This guide is continuation to setting up your programming
    environment. After you've read this, you know the basics of using your tools
    to contribute on open source projects.</p>

    <p>Here you will learn how to use Git, and the workflow of using them with
    online project hosting websites, such as what Github is.</p>

    <p>Git allows you contribute, or create your own web repositories.
    This is the fastest way to share your own creations with everyone else, and
    it also makes it easy for others to continue from where you left it.</p>
    
    <p>Do a search with 'git hosting', and you will find plenty of such hosting
    websites. But it may be best to use github for now, because that way you can
    contribute to my repositories and I can contribute to yours.</p>

    <p>We proceed in discovery order to give you an idea how you could
    have discovered this out on your own. You can read through the whole guide
    at first to find out the optimal order of setting it up. But there's no harm
    by just reading it all through.</p>

    <p>The prerequisite is that you've worked through
        <a href="/guides/vscode-getting-started">how to get
        started with vscode.</a> Open the hello-world folder with the 'File'
    -menu. If someone has deleted that directory, it's okay. Just create a new
    directory and put something there.</p>

    <p>In the left tab you've got this diamond shaped symbol, when you press it
    tells you 'git' is not installed.</p> 

    <img src="1.PNG"/>

    <p>If you click at the 'git-scm.com' -link, it starts to download git. Let
    it finish and run the installer. Then step through until you hit a following
    dialog.</p>

    <p>Earlier dialogs have lot of options, they seem to be right from the
    start, and it's okay for you to change them if you know something about what
    each means. One thing is that you probably want to keep the "Git Bash Here"
    and "Git GUI Here" installed. They are both very useful.</p>
    
    <p>In this dialog you are best off by checking 'Checkout as-is, commit
    as-is' here.</p>

    <img src="2.PNG"/>

    <p>There are lot of programming terms such as 'checkout' or 'commit' here.
    So it can look a bit chaotical.</p>

    <p>This whole thing is about handling line endings. Why you
    have to bother about this is very much
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline#History">historical</a>. In
    summary, many early computers fed text directly from the memory to a
    teletype printer head that printed characters to paper. CR is a control
    character that made the print head to switch to a new line.</p>

    <p>Because the print head was not fast enough, it did not manage to finish
    the operation in time and you would often see the next letter get printed to
    a middle of page. To avoid this, text files ended up with CR+LF sequence,
    with the LF doing nothing. This gave the print head enough time to
    return.</p>

    <p>Hardware drivers eventually ended up to abstract away the details, and
    computers were free to use a single character as newline. Unix adopted the
    LF as a newline, while Windows kept using CR+LF as a newline.</p>

    <p>The problem here is that Git is very sensitive for line feed
    characters. If the line feed convention changes along the way, it renders
    the Git diff useless. There are some places where you still see CR+LF used,
    but they appear in protocols and such, not in text files. The standard we use
    with Lever files is to just use LF everywhere.</p>

    <p>You should at least select either one of 'Checkout as-is' because this
    means you get a repository directory that is safe to move from a computer to
    an another without committing it through Git. You have an editor, that if
    you put like I proposed is configured to use LF everywhere. Also the VSCode
    doesn't force the file encoding so you shouldn't have problem with editing
    text files using any of the above settings.</p>

    <p>Once you have a git installed, you can create a git repository in
    VSCode!</p>

    <img src="3.PNG"/>

    <p>Now you have a git repository and the git tab is active. It's showing up
    the changes that haven't been committed to the repository.</p>

    <p>Git created a directory for you that has a history. Every git directory
    has a history that is stored in '.git' -folder. It is possible to checkout a
    from any point in this history and see how the directory looked back then.
    For example,
    <a href="https://github.com/cheery/lever/tree/887af5bcabeeb1c78050285e43485ba8837d7d75">here's the
    directory tree of a first commit to lever repository.</a> It looked like
that in October 29, 2014!</p>

    <p>This is very useful feature for managing your projects.</p>

    <img src="4.PNG"/>

    <p>The chances are transferred into history in stagings, multiple files at
    once. Every stage gets a message that should tell what was done.</p>

    <img src="5.PNG"/>
    <img src="6.PNG"/>
    <img src="7.PNG"/>

    <p>BOINK! Git hits you to the head! You lose 5 sanity points!!</p>
    <img src="8.PNG"/>
    <p>To avoid this, open the GIT Bash to get this kind of very discomforting
    black screen you've probably seen in hacking movies. Type the commands such
    as in the screenshot, but replace 'cheery' with user name of your own, and
    the email address with your own. These lines tag and identify the code you
    wrote.</p>

    <p>I'm not sure, but the name perhaps must be the same you use with your
    upcoming github account. You can change it later with this very same way.</p>

    <img src="12.PNG"/>

    <p>Now you should be able to commit!</p>

    <p>Generally you do not want to commit everything into your repository,
    you absolutely do not want to commit things other people shouldn't see such
    as your passwords or customized server configs. You also don't want to
    commit most binaries or files that get generated when you run your program.</p>

    <img src="15.PNG"/>

    <p>If you've run a program with lever, you got one right there named
    'main.lc.cb'. To ignore all files with lever bytecode file extension, add
    the following line '*.lc.cb' to new file '.gitignore'</p>

    <p>I also made '.vscodeignore', because I thought it would ignore files in
    vscode -view. Turns out I was wrong.</p>

    <img src="14.PNG"/>

    <p>When something becomes useless later on, you can delete it from the tree
    and stage a commit to delete it.</p>

    <p>Notice that this does not delete a file from the history.
    So if you commit a file you should have not commit, often the easiest way to
    truly remove it is to destroy the whole repository. There are some gentler, but
    very much more challenging ways to remove files. Best way to avoid this is
    to not do that error in the first place.</p>

    <p>If you can invalidate the information the file contains, it's usually
    better way than to change a git repository.</p>

    <img src="18.PNG"/>

    <p>If the file isn't very dangerous, the best way is to let it stay in the
    history. It's the job of git to handle the history. Let it do its job.</p>

    <p>So.. We gits have a hub these days. We call it Github!</p>

    <p>The following sequences shows out how to create a public repository where
    you can push changes from your local repository.</p>

    <img src="20.PNG"/>
    <img src="21.PNG"/>
    <img src="22.PNG"/>
    <p>Remember to keep the next page open.</p>
    <img src="23.PNG"/>

    <p>So there's no much use of this if you can't push your changes from your
    repository to the github repository. To use the above lines you need to open
    a Git Bash to your repository.</p>
    <img src="24.PNG"/>
    <p>If github is new SSH destination to you, you see this kind of
    message. Just type 'yes' as answer and press return.</p>
    <img src="25.PNG"/>
    <p>BOINK! Github hits you to the head! Well no. Actually it just denies your
    access to the repository because it cannot know it is yours. You need to
    authenticate.</p>
    <img src="26.PNG"/>
    <p>Public-key authentification.. Safer than any other authentification
    method as long as people do not snuff or see your private key. If it's not
    your personal computer that is safe from snoopys, remember to invalidate
    the key at github's end afterwards.</p>
    <img src="27.PNG"/>
    <p>The program prints out fancy things such as a fingerprint and ASCII art.
    They aren't very interesting. Check out the path it points out. Open the
    whole directory in your VSCode.</p>
    <img src="28.PNG"/>

    <p>The 'id_rsa' is a private key. People who have this key can identify as
    you. And you can identify as someone whose key you have.</p>

    <p>The 'known_hosts' probably contain the github now because you said
    'yes' to an important question. It's OK. Just good to know where those
    things go.</p>

    <p>The 'id_rsa.pub' is your public key. Copy it from your file!</p>

    <img src="29.PNG"/>

    <p>Go to <a
         href="https://github.com/settings/keys">https://github.com/settings/keys</a>
    in your browser and press 'New SSH Key', paste your public key and name it
    something that identifies the computer you have. I put 'esa computer' there
    because I am on his computer. Notice the button 'Delete' - that lets you
    invalidate your key any time.</p>

    <img src="30.PNG"/>

    <p>Next when you try the same thing as again, it lets you do it. Below you
    see the outcome.</p>

    <img src="32.PNG"/>

    <p>After a while also your VSCode recognizes this. You can notice you will
    be able to 'Sync', 'Pull' and 'Push' from the menu aside the 'do a barrel
    roll!' -button.</p>

    <p>I made a commit on the github website so I could pull. You see the '1'
    and a downarrow in the status bar aside the words 'master'. This means that
    you're in a master branch, and the 'remote' or github repository is 1 commit
    ahead of yours master branch.</p>

    <img src="33.PNG"/>

    <p>Doing the pull changes the markings, like this.</p>
    <img src="34.PNG"/>

    <p>So, is this worth all the effort? Might be the first thing you ask when
    you get accomodated to version control of any kind. I use it because it
    enables incredibly rapid collaboration and allows everyone to grab a
    development version and contribute.</p>

    <p>I have no brightest idea how it could benefit you. But you would be able
    of writing guides such as this, or sample programs. Or then improve and
    document the existing sample programs and guides using git &amp; github.</p>

    <p>Signing in to github also enables you to
    <a href="https://github.com/cheery/lever/issues">submit issues to lever repository</a>,
    allowing the community to react on what you feel you think needs work.</p>

    <p>Also it's weird but knowing how to use git&amp;github allows you to
    contribute to lots of things.
    <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux">For example there's this guy who
    wrote a kernel.</a> Say you wanted to contribute to such projects somehow,
    maybe fix something there for yourself. You could press the 'fork' button to
    get a clone of this repository to github where you can commit your own
    changes. Then you could make a 'new pull request' to the original maintainer
    and he can decide whether to pull your changes or not.</p>
    
    <p>If he doesn't like your changes and rejects them, you could keep your
    fork and still use it yourself, as long as you follow the license rules.
    It's even optional to keep it in sync with the mainline and update it from
    time to time, though you may want to stay updated for your sake if you fork
    a kernel.</p>

    <p>If want to write closed source code, you could ignore github or then use
    their private repositories -feature that costs a little bit. Overall using
    git is still useful even if you didn't intend to put anything online.</p>

    <p>There's lot ways to operate on git repositories using Git Bash. But
    they're out scope of what I should teach to you. This is here because I
    think it's something every programmer should know how to do.</p>

    <p>The guide coming after this one will explain how to compile Lever on
    windows 10. It's something skilled programmers want to do, because Lever can
    miss a feature or two they want, even if that feature was otherwise trivial
    to implement.</p>
