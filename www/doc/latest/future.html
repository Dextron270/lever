  id="01">01. Exploration </h2><p>People did a lot of computer science
related discoveries prior to the 1990s. A recurring theme was to make
the machine assist the user in programming. For a long time it was
impractical to implement such tools because computers were simply too
slow. </p><p>A lot of programming language implementations exist in a
calcified state. The internals that are left undocumented, as if
deliberately to discourage any significant changes to them. The user
is not supposed to change the implementation even if the source code
is available. </p><p>This means that our programming tools have
advanced by revolution rather than evolution. The possibility for a
real revolution shrinks every year a little bit. You just can&#x27;t
throw everything away once in a decade. </p><p>The internals of Lever
are highly flexible. Our goal is to retain this plasticity through the
lifetime of the language. </p><h3 id="01.1">01.1. Standardization
</h3><p>Having seen how node.js software breaks despite version
numbering makes us skeptical that version numbering is sufficient to
ensure compatibility. </p><p>In short: It is likely that semantic
versioning doesn&#x27;t really address issues related to changing
APIs. Node.js, as an example, follows semver but is messed up on a
regular basis. </p><p>As the result, we&#x27;re picking up something
that has been proven to communicate compatibility. We will establish a
standards board for our language. The standards established by the
board are used to ensure compatibility. </p><p>Version numbers will be
still used, but only for identifying releases of software. </p><h2
  id="02">02. Practicality </h2><p>We strive to create a practical
tool for solving difficult problems. Supremely abstract and
sophisticated programming languages usually perform badly. For this
reason the practical code is frequently written in crappy programming
languages. </p><h3 id="02.1">02.1. Code manipulation &#x2F; analysis
framework </h3><p>We are designing a framework to allow manipulation
and analysis of source code after it has been compiled into a bytecode
or loaded into the runtime environment. </p><p>This framework will be
supplied with optimization, partial evaluation, static analysis,
symbolic execution, theorem proving, validation, formal verification
tools and libraries. </p><h3 id="02.2">02.2. Improved
intermediate-results&#x2F;module code memoization </h3><p>Once we have
software with very good runtime behavior, we do not want to compile it
every time when a program is loaded. We require user-accessible
intermediate formats to make most out of machine code that is
produced. </p><p>On GPUs some of this has been already solved for us,
in form of the SPIR-V binaries. So we need to come up with something
that works with CPUs as well. </p><h3 id="02.3">02.3. Extensible
abstract arithmetic </h3><p>We want the arithmetic to be extensible
from the user side, but it is not very usable if you have to worry
about whether you just broke half of your language by introducing a
bad implicit conversion. </p><p>More about the subject in the <a
  href="http://boxbase.org/entries/2017/nov/6/addition-expression/">&quot;How
should the addition -expression behave?&quot;</a> </p><h3
  id="02.4">02.4. Live editing </h3><p>Smalltalk demonstrated
functionality where you could edit your software while it was running.
This is an incredibly powerful tool for design of software that is
highly interactive. </p><p>Today live programming doesn&#x27;t appear
to be supported on programming languages or their implementations.
Perhaps perceived to be too volatile for real-world use? While it
allows software to be developed quickly, it also allows to write the
kind of programs that never start again if you attempt to reset them.
</p><h3 id="02.5">02.5. Concurrency </h3><p>We have great tools for
implementing concurrency inside a single thread. </p><p>There are
concerns that the provided concurrency is too much and leads people to
writing unreliable software. We need to study these ideas formally and
see what kind of conclusions we get. It is possible there is something
we would have to consider even if our approach worked out apparently
well. </p><p>The paper <a
  href="http://www.erights.org/talks/promises/">&quot;Concurrency
Among Strangers&quot;</a> will be used as a starting point. </p><h3
  id="02.6">02.6. Custom formats and <a
  href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">protobuf</a>
</h3><p>Machine-readable logs and how the data is stored are going to
be more important in the future. </p><p>I think that protobuf got some
of the details right, mainly by selecting good design goals. But the
resulting tools were clumsy and difficult to use with dynamically
typed languages. </p><p>Protobuf also ignores the fact that sometimes
we want to observe and modify the data directly. The text editing was
perfected through efficient data structures such as the piece tables,
those could be also used here. There are more ways to diff
tree-structured data than there are ways to diff plain text, which
also could be useful with tightly packed non-compressed persistent log
data that protobuf attempts to cater for. </p><p>We are going to need
much better tools for handling binary data. Also need to decide on
formats. Likely we would like to derive something from protobuf
that&#x27;s better for the kind of persistent storage needs that arise
in the runtime. </p><h3 id="02.7">02.7. Pretty printing
</h3><p>Debugging a program often involves observing a state. To allow
this we could use really good set of tools for pretty printing. Since
we have environments where we can show 3D graphics, it would be
preferable that our pretty printing would match with this environment
while being backwards compatible with terminal views. </p><p>We would
somehow need to handle both passive and interactive forms of prints.
The interactive prints do not necessarily need to be
terminal-friendly. </p><h2 id="03">03. Penetration </h2><p>Since we
have a really nice language, we want to use it for something and see
how it fares. </p><p>Our current focus is on the graphics related
programming. To find a bit stronger niche we focus to software that
runs in Virtual Reality. </p><p>Ultimately we would like to develop
software in virtual reality and produce all assets while we are
&quot;in the program&quot; ourselves. </p></article><div
