  id="01">01. Benchmarks </h2><p>The benchmarks directory in lever is
still a bit of a stub when I am updating this text. So far I&#x27;ve
checked the JIT performance against a nbody simulation. </p><p>In the
samples directory there are already programs that are clearly no
longer usable without a working JIT. I can no longer expect to run
some of them without JIT enabled. </p><h2 id="02">02. Current
performance </h2><p>There&#x27;s a rudimentary way to compare
performance of CPython and Lever. Python runs a bootstrap compiler and
Lever has the same compiler as a library to allow it to run
standalone. </p><p>Lever is extremely heavy at how it compiles because
it uses customizable grammar with a parsing engine. It allows fast,
lisp-like experimentation with syntax. </p><p>We can trigger python
compiler by touching a file we want to benchmark with, then run the
compile-lib command.
</p><pre>cheery@ruttunen:~&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;lever$ touch lib&#x2F;c.lc
cheery@ruttunen:~&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;lever$ time python setup.py compile-lib
Compiling libraries for lever

real	0m1.603s
user	0m1.540s
sys	0m0.028s
cheery@ruttunen:~&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;lever$ 
</pre><p>Next
I wrote a small program that triggers a lever compiler to run on the
same file.
</p><pre>import binon, compiler

source = dir ++ &quot;lib&#x2F;c.lc&quot;
code = compiler.read_file(source, &quot;lib&#x2F;c.lc&quot;)
binon.write_file(dir ++ &quot;out.lc.cb&quot;, code)
</pre><p>The
results propose that Lever is 4 times slower than python at compiling
itself. But it is likely safe to say you could get worse results here.
</p><pre>cheery@ruttunen:~&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;lever$ time lever test.lc 

real	0m7.109s
user	0m6.808s
sys	0m0.288s
cheery@ruttunen:~&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;lever$ 
</pre><p>This
indicates rather similar results as in early tests. Worst-case
performance of RPython-written language that resembles Python seem to
be on the scale of 2 to 20 times slower. </p><h2 id="03">03. Future
performance </h2><p>PyPy has used RPython to provide a language that
is faster than Python on many occassions. With a new language
there&#x27;s not the restriction that we would have to fixate on some
implementation detail. This likely allows us to provide better results
than with PyPy. </p><p>We concentrate on narrow scope of software that
we want to make fast. Precisely desktop and graphically intensive
software. That should help too. </p><p>There are also some cases like
the vector arithmetic support in runtime that can really turn tables
in interesting scenarios into Lever&#x27;s favor. </p><h2
  id="04">04. When it is not enough... </h2><p>Even if we got near to
C speeds with Lever runtime some day, there is still the &quot;not as
fast as C&quot; -barrier in using dynamic languages to graphics
programming. No matter how it good it looked, it&#x27;s just not
enough when you got to crunch it all the way down. </p><p>I see that
the problem is not the performance of the language at this point.
It&#x27;s how well and how gradually can you lower out of it? Of
course we could prototype everything in Python if it was easy to
transition the performance critical code to the form where it
performs. There would be huge development gains to get things into
place in easy language and walk down from that in steps, rather than
having to do a big jump when you get the design right. </p><p>For this
reason I&#x27;ve picked some features that make Lever easier to
translate. When I&#x27;ll get things far enough for it to be useful,
I&#x27;ll replicate some of RPython&#x27;s translation framework on
Lever and repurpose it to apply on graphics. </p><p>There&#x27;s no
plans to get it to replace PyPy though. They are doing lots of good
things and I don&#x27;t see a reason to replicate the greater work
they do with the JIT generation along translation. They are doing
whole host of things I don&#x27;t have to do myself at this point.
</p><p>It&#x27;s nice to have a small, sub 10kloc runtime you can hack
away with. </p><h2 id="05">05. Platform performance considerations
</h2><p>There&#x27;s chance that WebAssembly succeeds to provide a
generic language target. This might happen somewhere between 2 to 6
years. </p><p>It will be very likely feasible to take this into
account and have Lever translate to WebAssembly. It requires that they
come up with their GC-integration and call&#x2F;cc -support.
</p><p>There&#x27;s very, very long run to this. But it would allow
both the translation framework and Lever itself use WebAssembly as a
target language. That would be sort of nice. </p><h2

-article comments</a>. </p><p>I realised I should probably mention my
plans to get Lever to perform somewhere. </p></article><div
