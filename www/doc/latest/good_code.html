  id="01">01. Top-down, Most relevant&#x2F;Most interesting first
</h2><p>I used to explain context-free grammars to my dad. started by
showing something like this:
</p><pre>expr_bot -&gt; term
          | &#x27;(&#x27; expr_top &#x27;)&#x27;
addition -&gt; addition &#x27;+&#x27; expr_bot
expr_top -&gt; addition
statement -&gt; expr_top &#x27;;&#x27;
file -&gt; statement
      | file statement 
</pre><p>He
explained it was hard to understand because it was written all upside
down. The highest thing in the hierarcy, largest piece forming up from
the other pieces was on the bottom. </p><p>He proposed the following
would be much cleaner:
</p><pre>file -&gt; statement
      | file statement 
statement -&gt; expr_top &#x27;;&#x27;
expr_top -&gt; addition
addition -&gt; addition &#x27;+&#x27; expr_bot
expr_bot -&gt; term
          | &#x27;(&#x27; expr_top &#x27;)&#x27;
</pre><p>I
had written the earlier program as I had because the evaluation flow
often forces you to put things that come first on the top because you
have to instantiate something before you have a reference to it, like
below:
</p><pre>pack1 = Packet(&quot;1&quot;)
pack2 = Packet(&quot;2&quot;)
platform1 = Platform(pack1, pack2)
platform2 = Platform(platform1)
</pre><p>I
kind of understood that this was an important point and tried out
writing some programs top-down, such that the entry point would end up
first. This is how I write code today:
</p><pre>main = ():
    window = open_window()
    rc = load_resources(resources)
    init(window)
    render(window, rc)

resources = {
    a = &quot;a.jpg&quot;
    b = &quot;b.jpg&quot;
}

init = (window):
    ... # not revelant on illustration

render = (window, rc):
    blit_texture(window, rc.a)
    blit_texture(window, rc.b)

blit_texture = (window, texture):
    ... # omitted
</pre><p>I
realised this way of ordering the hierarchy in a program this way was
immensely valuable. If you scroll into the text you would find out
immediately the overall idea of what the program is doing and have a
context to understand what comes next. </p><p>Sometimes I would even
do this on constants, that is position the constant lower into a file
and use it first. The reason being that the value of the constant
isn&#x27;t often interesting before it is used. </p><h2
  id="02">02. The semantic meaning of code </h2><p>When writing code
that is correct, the data types aren&#x27;t important. What is
important is the semantic meaning of the code. </p><p>For example lets
consider that we want to know an arithmetic mean value for a set of
values. A simple implementation of such program in Lever would be:
</p><pre>total = 0
for value in sequence
    total += value
return total &#x2F; sequence.length
</pre><p>The
above program relies on lot of facts: </p><ol><li>The sequence is
iterable </li><li>The values returned by iterating a sequence can be
added to &#x27;0&#x27; </li><li>The subsequent values can be divided
with their count </li><li>The sequence has a length and it reports it
correctly </li></ol><p>The elements the program has been made of
preserve their semantic meaning, eg. The addition doesn&#x27;t become
exponentiation </p><p>The program could be written like this as well:
</p><pre>it = iter(sequence)
count = 1
total = it.next()
for value in it
    total += value
    count += 1
return total &#x2F; count
</pre><p>This
program relies on different set of facts to be &#x27;correct&#x27;:
</p><ol><li>The sequence is iterable and not empty </li><li>The values
returned by sequence can be added with each other </li><li>The sum of
values can be divided by their count </li></ol><p>Both programs are
incorrect if you pass in an infinite sequence. If you do so, they also
do attempt to calculate the value and never recover from it on their
own. </p><p>Both programs are incorrect if you give them values that
do not correctly add up. </p><p>Also the correctness of the output is
bound to the correctness of the input. The program turns into giving
approximate values if you give them floating point values that are
approximate by their nature. </p><p>Since Lever doesn&#x27;t have full
numeric stack right yet, if you give the above program too big
integers, the integers will overflow and the program gives the wrong
result. </p><p>But for surprisingly many inputs, the both above
programs are perfectly valid. </p><p>You could try to argue the below
program is less correct because it fails on empty sequences. It really
depends on the context though. If the input sequence is not supposed
to be empty, the lower program would enforce the rule and therefore be
much more desirable to use. </p><p>The important thing to notice is
that static type systems, often advertised with safety, fail to
represent all the invariants of the above programs. Even if you did
dependent typing, there would be problems to represent everything that
the above program relies on to function in terms of type systems.
</p><p>Often type systems resort to overconstraining the programs. For
example you can guarantee that the sequence is not infinite and that
the values can be added together if you force the sequence to be an
array that contains integers. Forced correctness like this
doesn&#x27;t come for free. </p><p>If you later decide that instead of
arrays or integers you need lists and floats, you really have to work
through every definition that treats with the data before the program
can be compiled and tested again. A hefty price to pay for local
correctness. If you use automatic refactoring techniques, the
refactoring program isn&#x27;t aware about the constraints subjected
to the type anyway, so you may introduce an error unknowingly even if
everything was fully typed. </p><p>The efforts for perfection and
ultimate correctness in statically typed languages is left as an
exercise for academics who do not care about delivering or maintaining
software. </p><h2 id="03">03. Reliability through crashing
</h2><p>When a program encounters a condition it has not been designed
to handle, it should crash. A good crash is always the better option
when the another option is a good state corruption. </p><p>The origin
of this concept traces back to Erlang where programs have been
isolated from each other and monitored by other programs that restart
them if they happen to go down. </p><p>With dynamic typing you are
very likely to compose complex objects from simpler ones and then
there comes a time to take them apart. You will likely end up with the
following code:
</p><pre>if isinstance(a, str)
    str things
elif isinstance(a, int)
    int things
else
    assert false, repr(a)
</pre><p>The
&#x27;else&#x27; with an assert clause such as described here should
be very common occurrence in code that branches by type. </p><p>It is
likely that the language will get some syntax for dispatching from
types and patterns, for now such trivial improvements have to wait.
</p><h3 id="03.1">03.1. Multiple-dispatch errors </h3><p>The Texopic
HTML generator had this kind of code:
</p><pre>try
    html_env(node, context, out)
except KeyError as ke
    out.append(html.Node(&quot;pre&quot;, [texopic.stringify([node])]))
</pre><p>The
html_env dispatched code depending on which node type is being used.
Probably needless to say, this code also catched every single key
set&#x2F;get error in the generator and suspended them. </p><p>The
solution in this case was to add a default dispatch into texopic Scope
objects and use them instead. Catching errors originating from such
dispatch situations are problematic because they can very well cause
surprising situations during recursion. </p><h2 id="04">04. Premature
everything </h2><p>Some people like to watch the world burn. Then
there are people who like to create a new class, new file and a new
function every time they spot a task that might be separate or
reusable. </p><p>Seemingly it&#x27;s harmless to divide something into
its own function. Especially when you saw something similar earlier on
this very same page. Above the reason for additional functions was
that we needed functions to illustrate hierarchy and I didn&#x27;t
pick up a real example because I might not find something that would
exactly illustrate the point as well as an invented example.
</p><p>The problem in building up a new function when you see an
opportunity is that in any program there can be only that many
indirections before it becomes garbled for the person reading the
code. If you are eager to abstract things it means you&#x27;re almost
always losing the opportunity for the best abstraction you can make.
</p><h3 id="04.1">04.1. Premature generalization </h3><p>Lever has 2-4
implementations of the same pretty printing algorithm. It is not an
ideal situation. Usually you&#x27;d want just one implementation.
There is a reason they haven&#x27;t been unified yet. They are all
slightly different and I haven&#x27;t come up with the best design.
</p><p>Only lately I&#x27;ve come up to understand the problem and
aspects of it better to consider that I would be confident to design
something that works for all the cases I have had. But I&#x27;m still
postponing it until I need to pretty print things again and observe
how the various printers behave. </p><h3 id="04.2">04.2. Premature
perfection </h3><p>Everybody approves finished designs. Many would
prefer to have a full design up-front before they get to create
anything at all. </p><p>I used to erase my drawing if it doesn&#x27;t
turn out right. If the stroke wouldn&#x27;t come out right I would
press CTRL+Z and erase the stroke. Later I got some help by a
stranger. He taught me to leave the flawed stroke there. He told me
that&#x27;s how they used to do it when drawing on the paper. By
leaving the flawed stroke in you could draw more and then you would
see where the right stroke should go to. </p><p>Also I vividly
remember the lesson about &quot;drawing the space around the
subject&quot; rather than the subject itself, that was fairly helpful
advice too. </p><p>Achieving one failure can take a weekend, yet you
can learn from it more than from two months of up-front design work.
Also, they tend to say that couple of months in the laboratory can
frequently save a couple of hours in the library. So there is a sort
of hierarchy there. </p><p>So it&#x27;s great if you can learn from
your failures, even greater if you can learn from the failure of
others. </p><p>It&#x27;s weird that I had to be taught that thing
during drawing, because by then I was already using dynamically typed
languages all the time. These tools are designed for getting the first
stroke on the paper as quickly as it is possible. The obvious end
result is that at the first time you get something quickly that fails
to attain all or some of your objectives. Then you figure out what
went wrong and refine the solution until the problem gets solved.
</p><p>Mastering this aspect in your workflow makes the dynamic
programming languages a powerful tool in your repertuare.
