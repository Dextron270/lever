  src="../../toc-helper.js"></script><h2 id="01">01. Getting started
</h2><p>The first program to write in any language is the legendary
<i>&quot;hello, world&quot;</i>:
</p><p></p><pre>Print the words
hello, world
</pre><p>Lever program to
print the <i>&quot;hello, world&quot;</i> is:
</p><pre>print(&quot;hello, world&quot;)
</pre><p>To get the above
program to display anything, you need to setup yourself a programming
environment and install Lever&#x27;s runtime somewhere. </p><p>If you
wanted to be fancy, you would enclose this program inside a function
and write:
</p><pre>main = (args):
    print(&quot;hello, world&quot;)
</pre><p>The
parentheses &#x27;()&#x27; containing the function arguments, and the
colon &#x27;:&#x27; at the end of a line, forms a function. The
function contains the lines that are indented after it higher than
where the beginning of a line starts. </p><p>Lever adheres to the
off-side rule because it&#x27;s clean. Spaces vs. tabs are solved by
banning tab character in source files. Getting your indentation right
under these conditions requires either lot of labor or good tools to
work with. So it is very likely you won&#x27;t at least use a wordpad
or notepad for coding. That is in its own, a small victory.
</p><p>Functions are values you can set into variables or pass as
arguments. While most of the code runs a one line at a time until the
last line, the lines inside a function are not evaluated immediately.
The function stores a program that can be then called afterwards by
anything else. </p><p>For various reasons, if the entry module has a
variable &#x27;main&#x27;, the runtime will call the &#x27;main&#x27;
with the argument list. </p><p>One reason is that it helps at
structuring the program, but it also means that the entry program is
not run implicitly when the module is imported. </p><h3
  id="01.1">01.1. Control flow &amp; Fizz Buzz </h3><p>Most of the
control flow in Lever is quite ordinary and similar to Python except
that the colon only exist in the function definitions. Equipped with
this knowledge you could already write the fizz buzz program.
Here&#x27;s the description of the Fizz Buzz:
</p><p></p><pre>Fizz buzz is a group word game for children.
The first kid designated to go first says the number
&#x27;1&#x27;, and each children counts up one number in turn.
However, any number divisible by three is replaced by
the word &#x27;fizz&#x27;, any divisible by five is replaced by
the world &#x27;buzz&#x27;, numbers divisible by both become &#x27;fizz
buzz&#x27;.
A player who hesitates or makes a mistake is eliminated
from the game.
</pre><p>A
popular interview screening question reduces above description into a
program that prints out the correct sequence of the first 100 Fizz
buzz numbers.
</p><p></p><pre>1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz,
13, 14, Fizz Buzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz, Fizz, 22, 23,
Fizz, Buzz, 26, Fizz, 28, 29, Fizz Buzz, 31, 32, Fizz,
34, Buzz, Fizz, ...
</pre><p>It
bores out the heck out of you. Here&#x27;s the program in the Lever:
</p><pre>for i in range(1, 101)
    if (i % 3) == 0 and (i % 5) == 0
        print(&quot;Fizz Buzz&quot;)
    elif (i % 3) == 0
        print(&quot;Fizz&quot;)
    elif (i % 5) == 0
        print(&quot;Buzz&quot;)
    else
        print(i)
</pre><p>This
is exactly how you would do it in python, except that there are no
colons in the control flow expressions. </p><p>The &#x27;range(1,
101)&#x27; is an iterator that produces a sequence starting with 1 and
ending to 100. The &#x27;for&#x27; takes and pulls values one at a
time from the iterator until it is emptied. </p><p>The
&#x27;if&#x27;-&#x27;elif&#x27;-&#x27;else&#x27; chain should be
familiar for any Pythonista, there is a small pitfall where you may
stumble here though. </p><p>The following program would always print
&#x27;Fizz&#x27; no matter of what number you give for &#x27;i&#x27;:
</p><pre>if not i % 3
    print(&quot;Fizz&quot;)
</pre><p>Lever has
an identity rule that if something has to be treated as a boolean, it
will always be treated as &#x27;true&#x27;, except if it is
&#x27;false&#x27; or &#x27;null&#x27;. </p><p>This means that
&#x27;bool(0)&#x27; is true. It can be a bit of a gotcha for new
programmers, but it means that you can check for an absence or
existence of a value with bare condition like this:
</p><pre>if theme_park
    visit(theme_park)
</pre><p>This works most
of the time because most of the time you don&#x27;t expect the
theme_park to be &#x27;false&#x27;, if there&#x27;s a possibility that
it is &#x27;null&#x27;. </p><p>For booleans and null, the
&#x27;==&#x27; is used as an identity equality, so if you have to
differentiate between null and false, you can use equality for that.
</p><p>Overall there&#x27;s a thumb of rule that Lever generally
doesn&#x27;t diverge from the other languages unless there is some
reason to diverge. </p><p>Before we proceed to explore Lever further,
it is a good time to review how Lever became to be, to whom it is
made, and what it will become. </p><h2 id="02">02. Focus audience
</h2><p>The core audience of Lever are programmers doing realtime
graphics or audio, interactive applications, GPU computing,
simulation, game development, virtual reality. </p><p>The choice of
audience is fairly arbitrary. The main reason for this is that there
are plenty of good languages for web development. Also the author is
personally interested about the aforementioned subjects. </p><p>It is
really common response from people to wonder why would anyone want to
write something like a rendering engine or a FEM solver in a
dynamically typed programming language? Why create a language into the
second slowest class of programming languages and sign it for this
purpose of writing high performance software? </p><p>The reason is to
bring down the time to market in order to produce extremely advanced
and profoundly complex software. It initiates the space race of the
programming world. </p><p>The fact is that only 1% of your software
need to run really fast. Only the 1% of the program is the FEM part,
or simulation, or anything else that really has to run as fast as what
the hardware can support. It&#x27;s not true for all software, but for
most software there is very small portion of code where it has to
perform. </p><p>The earlier dynamic programming languages lacked in
utilities to support this case. There is a certain top performance
where Javascript goes with its JIT. To go beyond that you have to jump
off into C&#x2F;C++ language. </p><p>With Lever we intend to break
this barrier with partial evaluation and program translation
techniques. </p><h3 id="02.1">02.1. Past and future </h3><p>I think of
Lever as a some sort of a next-generation LISP language. </p><p>Lever
is capable of growing and changing in ways that aren&#x27;t unusual
for the languages from the LISP family. The LISPs have been capable of
changing because of two reasons: </p><ol><li>LISP program structure is
similar to its syntax. </li><li>The programs are data in the language,
and vice versa, the data can be translated into programs.
</li></ol><p>To achieve this, LISP family of languages make the
consistent tradeoff from the syntax, giving them the sobriquet of
&quot;lots of superfluous parentheses&quot;, as seen from <a
  href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/FizzBuzz#Scheme">this scheme
sample at rosettacode.org</a>
</p><p></p><pre>(do ((i 1 (+ i 1)))
    ((&gt; i 100))
    (display
      (cond ((= 0 (modulo i 15)) &quot;FizzBuzz&quot;)
            ((= 0 (modulo i 3))  &quot;Fizz&quot;)
            ((= 0 (modulo i 5))  &quot;Buzz&quot;)
            (else                i)))
    (newline))
</pre><p>Although
LISP languages have their own fans and disciples, they have hard time
competing with modern languages that have syntax built on context-free
grammars. </p><p>Some say that the qualities of the LISP languages are
lost if you change away from the syntax. That is true to an extent.
For example, the syntax in Python is difficult to change or improve.
</p><p>Giving Lever a complete syntax-makeover is a matter of
providing it a different grammar file. To give it new semantics you
will edit a table inside a compiler. </p><p>To store information we
use JSON whenever possible. To store bytecode we use a custom binary
format that surpasses JSON only in its ability to contain
type-annotated buffers. </p><p>The full parsing and compiling
infrastructure of Lever is accessible from the Lever language itself.
</p><p>The interpreter and the runtime of the language is written in
Python and it is translated into machine code from there. A JIT
compiler is generated along the way. </p><p>Lever started as a
LISP-variant and when it still was a Lisp I called it
&#x27;pyllisp&#x27;. As in &#x27;python-inspired lisp&#x27;.
</p><p>Lever&#x27;s capability to change the syntax comes from the use
of the <a href="https://jeffreykegler.github.io/Marpa-web-site/">marpa
parsing algorithm</a>. It is a parsing algorithm made by Jeffrey
Keggler and it is based on Earley parsing algorithm. Thanks to this
algorithm there is no a language with &quot;more beautiful
syntax&quot; than Lever. If there is.. ;-) Well. You will know what
happens. </p><p>Actually once I have used Lever I have lost most of my
excitement over syntax. When a language can look like anything I want,
it can as well be what it is. </p><p>As of writing this, Lever
implementation consists of total 11849 lines of Python and 15173 lines
of Lever code. It is maturing enough to receive its first draft of a
translation framework soon. </p><h3 id="02.2">02.2. Iterative
development </h3><p>Malleability of Lever is a result of its design
philosophy. The philosophy boils down to the idea that a live cow is a
better study subject than a dead cow if you intend to make a better
cow. </p><p>Lever is a quickly built language that works as a study
tool to build a better language. The discoveries are distilled into
improvements and built into Lever&#x27;s design. </p><p>Since Lever is
a tool for designing itself as much as it is a programming language,
it has the according upsides and downsides. </p><p>The biggest
downside for a potential user is that the Language is changing all the
time and there&#x27;s not any signs that this would change anytime
soon. </p><p>The second biggest downside is that there are things that
are undone intentionally. When the author has solved the certain
problem, he has proceeded to solve a more pressing problem instead of
wasting effort to finish the work. </p><p>Also there are some other
downsides such as: </p><ol><li>The documentation is designed to lag
behind because the documentation flows upwards from the code.
</li><li>The author prioritizes his problems first, so it may take a
while for your problem to be fixed. </li><li>Many python concepts have
been ditched and at some places there&#x27;s an inferior concept
present. </li><li>The &quot;easy&quot; or trivial improvements of the
language haven&#x27;t been done because there has been harder things
to fix. </li><li>Many bugs remain unfixed until they become relevant
to the author. </li></ol><p>One upside is that the language is simple
to improve, perhaps even if you weren&#x27;t the author. Especially it
is easy if your runtime-sided code can be first tested in a Python for
bugs before being compiled in time-consuming manner into machine code.
</p><p>Another upside is that Lever stays updated, competitive and
fresh as the time passes. </p><p>If you&#x27;re still interested about
the language, keep reading. </p><h2 id="03">03. Variables
</h2><p>Lever has a lexical variable scoping. It is not very different
from other imperative languages, such as C, Python, BASIC in that
sense. To illustrate the scope, we can find a practical and a fun
example in the Lever&#x27;s C parsing library:
</p><pre>trigraph_getch = (getch):
    ch0 = getch()
    ch1 = getch()
    return ():
        ch2 = getch()
        if ch0 == &#x27;?&#x27; and ch1 == &#x27;?&#x27; # This is equivalent to how big compilers
            try                      # are doing it.
                ch = trigraphs[ch2]  # Three-character window and checking if
                ch0 := getch()       # There&#x27;s a trigraph on it.
                ch1 := getch()
                return ch
            except KeyError as _
                null
        ch = ch0
        ch0 := ch1
        ch1 := ch2
        return ch

trigraphs = {
    &quot;=&quot;: &quot;#&quot;,
    &quot;&#x2F;&quot;: &quot;\\&quot;,
    &quot;(&quot;: &quot;[&quot;,
    &quot;)&quot;: &quot;]&quot;,
    &quot;!&quot;: &quot;|&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;&quot;: &quot;{&quot;,
    &quot;&gt;&quot;: &quot;}&quot;,
    &quot;-&quot;: &quot;~&quot;,
}
</pre><p>This
thing is an optional filter into getch -function. It parses trigraphs
if it is inserted. Trigraphs are an old and obsolete method to insert
characters that are missing on your keyboard. In practice it would
mean that if you didn&#x27;t have a way to type &#x27;#&#x27;, you
could use the &#x27;??=&#x27; instead and the compiler would interpret
it the same way. </p><p>The trigraph_getch gets the &#x27;getch&#x27;
as an argument that would be otherwise used to fetch characters. In
return it provides its own function that will be used as a
replacement, right after it has grabbed two characters as a
&quot;lookahead&quot;. </p><p>The inner function starting at the
&#x27;return ():&#x27; has access to the scope that contains the
&#x27;ch0&#x27; and &#x27;ch1&#x27; variables. If it is used as a
&#x27;getch&#x27; instead of the original one, like how this is
intended to be used, then each call grabs a new character, but instead
of returning it immediately it will consume it and return something
else. </p><p>First the inner function checks whether the ch0 and ch1
lookahead contains ??. If it does it will try to check the trigraph
dictionary, that&#x27;s provided after the trigraph_getch function,
for a match. If it finds a match it will fill the ch0 and ch1
variables with new characters and return a replacement. Otherwise it
lets the program flow pass downwards. We use &#x27;null&#x27; in the
exception handle to indicate that the exception handling is absent.
</p><p>The current syntax is designed such that the changes to the
upscope must be explicit. The assignment with &#x27;=&#x27; always
sets a local variable. To set an upscope variable you have to do
&#x27;:=&#x27;. I&#x27;m not sure whether the benefit is big enough to
keep it this way, but I think it is very clean and the lexical scope
doesn&#x27;t cause any big surprises this way. </p><p>Also the
operations such as &#x27;+=&#x27; look up an existing variable and
have an effect on the upscope. It is kind of logical behavior from
them. </p><p>If the program doesn&#x27;t face a trigraph, it fills the
return ch with the first character in the lookahead buffer and shifts
the values in the lookahead buffer to fit in the newly fetched
character. </p><h2 id="04">04. Arithmetic </h2><p>Lever has built-in
support for vector arithmetic. The intention is to extend it until
it&#x27;s as wide as in the GLSL and as wide as what SPIR-V
acknowledges. Smarter people can guess why and get distracted, but
what I want to point out here is how the arithmetic in Lever can be
extended. </p><p>Here is a sphere-ray intersection code written in
Lever:
</p><pre>sphere_ray_intersect = (sphere, ray):
    radius2 = sphere.radius*sphere.radius
    d = sphere.center - ray.orig
    tca = dot(d, ray.dir)
    d2 = dot(d, d) - tca * tca
    if d2 &gt; radius2
        return null
    thc = sqrt(radius2 - d2)
    return object();
        t0 = tca - thc
        t1 = tca + thc
</pre><p>You
may likely guess which things here calculate a dot product and so on.
If I&#x27;m crazy enough I may consider to provide sphere.radiusÂ² and
sphere.radiusÂ³ someday, but not today. </p><p>Note that the code
returns &#x27;null&#x27; if the value is absent. If it is present,
then we return an object(). The semicolon in the end &#x27;;&#x27; is
grabbing the variables from the indented block and assigning them to
the object(). Therefore you get an object with .t0 and .t1 attributes
in it. </p><p>The object() serves as a custom record you can use
whenever an object defined by a full class isn&#x27;t reasonable. It
has an advantage over a class-defined object that it can implicitly
convert into a dictionary. </p><p>But enough about the intersection
code. You&#x27;ll want to know how the vector subtraction is
implemented. </p><h3 id="04.1">04.1. Multimethods </h3><p>Because
Lever used to be a Lisp-variant, it retrieves the operators such as
&#x27;-&#x27; from the module scope. If you are passive-aggressive,
you could rewrite the &#x27;-&#x27; into a print method by a very
simple command:
</p><pre>%&quot;-&quot; = print # What the?
1-2          # Now it prints &quot;1 2&quot;!
</pre><p>The
%&quot;&quot; syntax treats a string as a name of a variable slot. The
following code reveals what the &quot;-&quot; command is:
</p><pre>print(%&quot;-&quot;)
</pre><p>It prints out
&lt;multimethod&gt;. Note that the prefix plus and minus signs refer
to the %&quot;+expr&quot; and %&quot;-expr&quot; respectively. That is
the negation and subtraction are clearly different things.
</p><p>There is a way to look at what the %&quot;+&quot; has eaten.
Multimethods have .arity, .keys() and .default
</p><pre>print(%&quot;+&quot;.arity)
print(%&quot;+&quot;.keys()...)
print(%&quot;+&quot;.default)
</pre><p>This
prints out:
</p><p></p><pre>2
[vec3, vec3] [int, int] [float, float]
&lt;builtin default&gt;
</pre><p>It
looks very simple, considering that Lever can calculate &#x27;false -
true&#x27; and return &#x27;-1&#x27;. It is disturbingly simple.
</p><p>The %&quot;-&quot; multimethod requires at least two arguments.
If it gets 2 or more arguments, it retrieves the interface of those
two arguments and goes to check into a lookup table. </p><p>For each
interface, the multimethod will make a quick check whether the
interface appears in a table. It will take a super() of the interface
until it finds a looping interface or an interface that appears in the
table. </p><p>Before doing the check into a lookup table, the
multimethod&#x27;s interface table is checked to see whether there is
any method registered for an interface. If there isn&#x27;t, the
</p><p>If the interface has never seen that lookup table, the
multimethod will take a supertype of the interface until it can find
it from the table. If it reaches a null interface before finishing, it
will give up and it just returns the interface. </p><p>If there&#x27;s
a method in the lookup table, the multimethod will let the method take
over. This only happens if the two arguments are common combination
and present in the table. Otherwise the multimethod will transfer to
the .default if it exists. </p><p>The .default can do anything in a
multimethod. The builtin arithmetic default is equivalent to the:
</p><pre>%&quot;+&quot;.default = (args):
    return %&quot;+&quot;.call_suppressed(coerce(args...)...)
</pre><p>Coerce
attempts to implicitly convert the values such that they go into the
usual forms. For example. The coerce(false, true) converts the values
to 0 and 1. So the false - true is equivalent to calling the
int(false) - int(true), or 0 - 1. </p><p>The default method on the
.coerce is null, so if the method isn&#x27;t in the coerce table, then
the multimethod fails with &#x27;no method&#x27; -error followed by
the type combination. </p><p>The .call_suppressed calls the
multimethod again, with the exception that this time the .default
won&#x27;t be visited if it fails again. This limits the coercion into
a single cycle. </p><p>This is not a perfect solution to this problem
and it is especially problematic with the comparison operators, but it
is far much preferred to the Gang-of-four pattern present in Python.
The reason is that we can actually reason about the behavior of this
function by checking only into two tables while the program is
running. </p><p>Multimethods will help with JIT and with abstract
interpretation of programs in overall. But you better note that adding
methods into the table will interfere with JIT that uses those methods
for now. </p><p>The rule about multimethod calling super may look like
weird but it has a good reason to be there. It allows the extensions
of an interface satisfy the usual subtyping constraints. </p><p>The
thing is, if you create something like a Val that has defined
multimethods. The extensions of that will keep using the same
multimethod definitions just like that until you define new
multimethods for your extended interface. </p><h3
  id="04.2">04.2. Autodiff </h3><p>Lever stdlib comes with autodiff
module. It is in it&#x27;s infancy and currently driving the design of
Lever. </p><p>Automatic differentiation is a technique to retrieve a
differential of a function without rewriting it. </p><p>In lever
autodifferentiation is activated by importing the &#x27;autodiff&#x27;
module and constructing variables with it.
</p><pre>import autodiff

x = autodiff.var()
for i in range(10)
    y = autodiff.ad_sin(x(i) * 2)
    print(&quot;x:&quot;,    i,
          &quot;y:&quot;,    y.real,
          &quot;y&#x2F;dx:&quot;, y.d(x))
</pre><p>Program
output (slightly formatted for readability):
</p><p></p><pre>x: 0 y:  0.0            y&#x2F;dx:  2.0
x: 1 y:  0.909297426826 y&#x2F;dx: -0.832293673094
x: 2 y: -0.756802495308 y&#x2F;dx: -1.30728724173
x: 3 y: -0.279415498199 y&#x2F;dx:  1.9203405733
x: 4 y:  0.989358246623 y&#x2F;dx: -0.291000067617
x: 5 y: -0.544021110889 y&#x2F;dx: -1.67814305815
x: 6 y: -0.536572918    y&#x2F;dx:  1.68770791746
x: 7 y:  0.990607355695 y&#x2F;dx:  0.273474436416
x: 8 y: -0.287903316665 y&#x2F;dx: -1.91531896065
x: 9 y: -0.750987246772 y&#x2F;dx:  1.32063341649
</pre><p>In
future programs, rather than calling &#x27;autodiff.ad_sin&#x27;, the
&#x27;sin&#x27; is defined as a multimethod, and the autodiff just
adds a new method for itself. </p><p>Future plans for the
autodifferentiator include making it more featureful and capable of
calculating further auxiliary results. They are also a great target
for JIT compiler optimizations and should interact favorably with
numerous other standard libraries in Lever. </p><h2 id="05">05. Not
yet covered in here </h2><ol><li>Classes and customization of objects
</li><li>C foreign function interface that fetches the header
definitions from a json file. </li><li>A documentation system that can
