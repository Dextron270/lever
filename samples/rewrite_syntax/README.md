This sample shows how to try a different syntax with Lever
runtime and semantics.

When you are experimenting with syntax you may still want
to keep the runtime libraries in the old language. The
contents of this directory show how to do it.

The main.lc holds several entry points that use the modified
language and creates a module scope for it.
